a pure js util collection - atomic, independent

# why

i wrote a bunch of utility/helper stuff in a bunch of projects, and this is a collection of those.

sometimes i wrote them with jQuery, sometimes with angular, i want to make them "independent".

the "independent" is quoted, because it requires new features from ECMA5, i strongly recommend each project will include the ECMA5 polyfils:

* f
* s

# the coffee script code might not work now

i just try to switch to coffee
